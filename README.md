# HA SwitchPlate

The HA SwitchPlate is a user-programmable LCD touchscreen you can mount into a [standard North American work box](https://www.nema.org/Standards/ComplimentaryDocuments/NEMA%20WD%206%20-%20Dimensions%20for%20Wiring%20Devices%20-%20Excerpt.pdf) in place of a light switch.  It connects to your home automation system over WiFi to send and receive [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) messages in response to user interactions on the screen or events happening in your home.  The result is an attractive and highly-customizable controller for your home automation system which you can build yourself!

The HA SwitchPlate ("HASP") utilizes a [Nextion 2.4" LCD Touchscreen display](https://www.itead.cc/nextion-nx3224t024.html) mounted in a 3D-printed enclosure as a touchscreen panel for home control and information display.  An [ESP8266-based microcontroller](https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d1:d1_mini) provides WiFi connectivity and system control.  The project has been developed to integrate with [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) but [should be compatible](Documentation/06_MQTT_Control.md) with any other MQTT-enabled automation platform such as [OpenHAB](https://github.com/openhab/openhab1-addons/wiki/MQTT-Binding), [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/MQTT), [Node-Red](http://noderedguide.com/tag/mqtt/), [Wink](https://github.com/danielolson13/wink-mqtt), [SmartThings](https://github.com/stjohnjohnson/smartthings-mqtt-bridge), [Vera](https://github.com/jonferreira/vera-mqtt), [HomeKit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homekit2mqtt), etc.

The [Arduino code](Arduino_Sketch) for the ESP8266 provides a generic gateway between [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) and the [Nextion instruction set](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/Nextion_Instruction_Set).  A basic [Nextion HMI display file](Nextion_HMI) has been included with several pages of various layouts to provide user controls or to present information in response to MQTT messages sent to the device.

## Purchase an assembled unit

As this build requires some specialist skills and tools, I will occasionally be [offering assembled devices for sale here](https://www.tindie.com/products/luma/ha-switchplate-hasp-single-wide-assembled/).

## Bill of Materials

To build a simple version of this project you will minimally need the [Nextion display](https://www.itead.cc/nextion-nx3224t024.html) and the [WeMos D1 Mini](https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d1:d1_mini), 4 jumper wires, and a USB cable to power both devices.

A complete build that's ready to install will require the following components:

* [Nextion 2.4" LCD Touchscreen display](https://www.itead.cc/nextion-nx3224t024.html)
* [WeMos D1 Mini ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller](https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d1:d1_mini)
* [3D printed switch plate](3D_Printable_Models/HASwitchPlate_front_single.stl)
* [3D printed rear cover](3D_Printable_Models/HASwitchPlate_rear_nolcdmod.stl)
* [Mean Well IRM-03-5 AC to 5VDC Power supply](https://www.findchips.com/search/IRM-03-5)
* [PCB](PCB/)
* [4pin 2.54mm JST-XH female PCB header](https://www.amazon.com/GeeBat-460pcs-Connector-Housing-Adapter/dp/B01MCZE2HM)
* [Rubber grommet](https://www.mcmaster.com/#9600k41)
* [Two M2 self-tapping 6MM screws](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FXGHO2M) (or just any 4-6mm M2 machine screws)
* 6" each of white and black 300V 18AWG stranded power cables (I just stripped some wire out of a power cord)
* [Four 20mm M2 flathead screws](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FN3Q94) and [four 3mm M2 threaded inserts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IZ157KS) to fasten things together (feel free to improvise here)
